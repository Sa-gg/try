Components
Functional Components
It can take props and can hold state or data

State 
- represents the data that a component manages internally
- form input data, fetched data, UI-related data like if a modal is open/close
- to define state you can use a HOOK
- useState() hook which is a built-in react hook
- global state, which relates to the app as a whole and not a single component
- third party management system like REDUX

Hooks
